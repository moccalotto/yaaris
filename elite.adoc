== ELITE WARRIORS

=== Berserker

==== Level 6

===== Recovery Die
Your {recovery_die} is 1d12.

===== More Hit Points
Your {hit_point_total} is increased by 12.

===== Better Stats
Increase your __constitution__ and __strength__ by one point each, and increase
one other stat by one point as well.

===== No Armor
You fight without armor and shields. If you equip any armor pieces or shields, 
you lose the ability to go berserk.

===== Bonus Hit Points
You gain 3 bonus hit points per unused item slot. Other adventurers only get one.
This hit point bonus increases by one every time you gain a level, such that when
you're level 10, you gain 7 bonus hit points per unused item slot.

===== Berserker's Rage
You can choose to go berserk when someone has drawn the blood of one or more of
you or your, causing at least one hit point of damage. This rage lasts as long
as someone attacks or your allies. If an entire combat round passes without you
or your allies being attacked, your rage ends.

Being berserk has the following properties:

* The damage you deal with heavy weapons is doubled.
* You gain 2 extra moves, and that number increases by one every time you 
  gain a level, such that when you are level 10, you have 7 extra moves per
  round.
* You have {advantage} on all  __strength__, __constitution__, and
  __dexterity__ checks.
* You have {disadvantage} on all  __intelligence__, __wisdom__, and
  __charisma__ checks.
* You do not roll on the {death_table} when you reach zero hit points;
  you simply remain alive and kicking. But when you are at zero hit points and
  take damage, you must roll on the {trauma_table}, just like other adventurers
  when they take {damage_at_zero_hp}.
* If you reach zero hit points the damage you deal with heavy weapons is
  tripled instead of doubled.
* When your berserker's rage ends, you take __L__d6 damage, where __L__ is your 
  level.
* If your rage ends when you are at zero hit pints, you must roll on the 
  {death_table}.

== Spells

=== Gate (X)
*Level 7+, mage*

* Magical portal opens within {X} meters of you.
* A similar magical portal opens within 10·{X} kilometers of you in a place
  you have been to within the last {X} days.
* The two portals connect the two places like a wormhole, a tunnel of zero
  length.

=== Great Resurrection (X)
*Level 7+, champion*

This spell can revive anyone with the adventurer's blessing who has not yet
been turned undead and whose level is lower than X.

You must first fast for at least a day, and then you cast this spell,
chanting for <<X>> hours, upon which you touch the corpse of the creature
you wish to revive.

You then permanently lose one point from a random stat - this loss cannot be
undone in any way.
The recipient must roll 1d20 for every stat. If they roll __above__ a stat's
score, that stat is reduced by 1. This usually means that the recipients worst
stats get even worse. These losses are permanent and cannot be undone.

This spell requires a diamond worth at least 400·<<X>> gold pieces, which is
consumed by the spell.

[[quote]]
Since this spell takes a permanent toll on the caster, it is difficult to find
a caster who is willing to cast this spell, and if they can be persuaded, it
will most likely be extremely expensive.
