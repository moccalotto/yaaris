==== Armor Skills
You are skilled at using light and medium armor, as well as light and medium
shields.

==== Champion Spellcasting

As a champion, you can use __champion's spellbooks__ to cast spells more
efficiently.


*Champion's spellbooks* are an upgraded version of basic spellbooks, that have
the following properties:

* They can contain both __basic__ and __champion__ spells.
* They can only be used by the champion they are attuned to.
* They allow for more fast an easy spellcasting.

*Champion's spellcasting* is done by by grasping a one of your champion's
spellbooks firmly in one hand, holding it up, and __shouting__ an incantation
from memory. Once this is done, you roll a __charisma__ check, and if it
succeeds, you cast the spell. As opposed to __basic spellcasting__, you only
need one free hand, and you do not need the ability to read the text in the
book.

*Creating a champion's spellbook* is done by upgrading one of your basic
spellbooks. It takes one hour per spell level and requires one __consumption__
of __magic components__ per spell level. The spell in the source book must not
have a higher level than you. Once upgraded, the spellbook is attuned to you,
and only you can use it.

[quote]
Like basic spellbooks, the champion's spellbook is faintly magical, and can be
detected with __Detect Magic__ spells.

*Reattuning a champion's spellbook* from one champion to you requires an hour
per spell level, one consumption of __magic components__ per spell level, and
can only be done if your level is at least as high as the spell's level.

==== Peaceful Rest
You acquire a champion's spellbook with the spell <<_peaceful_rest_x>> on it.
It has 1 __usage point__, and when you carry it, it does not take up any __item
slots__.

using.


//KEY:
*Acrobat*: By spending an __action__ you can jump up to __dexterity__ meters

checks__) when using your lockpicking tools, and one of the sets of lockpicking
tools you carry do not take up an __item slot__.

you use to determine if the baddie goes unconscious is 1d10, and if the
baddie's level is lower than yours, you roll your d10 with __advantage__. When
you chose this ability, and you already have the "`__shady__`" adventurer's
ability, you may switch that ability for something else if you want.

checks__) when using your tinkering tools, and one of the sets of tinkering

and you are within __charisma__ meters of the "path" of the baddie, you are
able to track the actual path of the target.


//KEY:
*Venom Specialist*: You can make poisonous venom from dead monster parts. It
requires a dead monster, a bonfire or similar, one hour of preparation, one
__consumption__ of <<alchemist_tools>>, and one steel bottle to create a dose
of venom that can coat the business end of a slashing or piercing weapon.

It takes one __action__ to apply a readied bottle of venom to a readied weapon,
and it lasts for up to one week one the weapon.

Once a weapon has been coated, you add __L__d6 to the damage of the next
successful attack with that weapon, where __L__ is the level of the person who
created the poison.
