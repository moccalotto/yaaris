==== Armor Skills
You are skilled at using light and medium armor, as well as light and medium
shields.

==== Champion Spellcasting

As a champion, you get an improved magical ability where you can upgrade your
basic spellbooks into __Champion's Spellbooks__.

*Champion's spellbooks* are an upgraded version of basic spellbooks; they have
been imbued with the fire of your spirit, linking them to you so you alone can
use them, and you can cast them much more easily.

*Creating a champion's spellbook* is done by upgrading an existing basic
spellbook. The spell in the source book must not have a higher level than
yours, it takes an hour per spell level, and it requires one __consumption__ of
__magic components__ per spell level. Once upgraded, the book is completely
attuned to you, and only you can use it to cast spells. There are, however,
magical rituals that can convert a champion's spellbook back into a basic
spellbook, and there are also rituals that can attune champion's spellbook to
another champion.

[quote]
Like basic spellbooks, the champion's spellbook is faintly magical, and can be
detected with __Detect Magic__ spells.

*You can cast a spell with a champion's spellbook* by grasping the spellbook
firmly in one hand, holding it up, and __shouting__ an incantation from memory.
Once this is done, you roll a __charisma__ check, and if it succeeds, you cast
the spell.


* You can upgrade a basic spellbook into a champion's spellbook.
* It can only be used by _you_.
* You use it with only one hand, by holding it up and __shouting__ a champion's
  prayer. 
* You do not need to see or read.
* You still have to speak and move.
* It is recharged with __holy components__ instead of __magic components__.
