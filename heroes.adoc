HEROES


== Spells

=== Detect Undead, Major
*Level 4. Duration: _wisdom_ hours.*

This spell works like Detect Undead, Minor, except that when you detect an
undead creature, you roll a _intelligence_ check, and if it succeeds you
discern whether the creature's level is higher than your own.


=== Trauma (X) ===
*Level 6*
You touch a baddie who must roll on the trauma table: 1d100+_X_.
