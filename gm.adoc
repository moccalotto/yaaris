== Undeath
Things very easily become undead. To avoid this:

a. Burn the corpse.
b. Cut off _all_ limbs.
c. Cut off head and spike heart.
d. Put a spike it its heart and a silver coin in its mouth.
e. Give the corpse a proper burial.

== Items

=== Shower in a Bottle
Makes you clean, but for dogs sake, don't drink it.
Also, makes you smell "fresh" (lavender, etc.) so it does not hide your scent.
