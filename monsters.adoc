[quote,Oralix LeDique]
Orcs are to trees what undeads to the Enlightened.


Green-skinned creatures that are created when trees and large plants die from
unnatural causes.

* Orcs are a category containing  orcs, (hob) goblins, trolls, cyclops
* Not gnolls.
* Created completely from plant matter => green skins.
* They exude a kind of blight that slowly degenerates vegetation, which makes
  the orcs stronger.
* Sometimes destroy forests to create more orcs.
* Only become undead if some outside force (such as an evil mage) turns them.
* Tough, extreme pain tolerance, and high morale.
* Individual orcs have animalistic intelligence, but sometimes a Great Leader
  that can control or direct the entire army.

  traumatic events such as war, assault, and magical accidents.

* Undeads almost always have worse stats than when they were alive.
* Generally immune to fear.
* Generally slower.
