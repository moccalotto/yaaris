living organic matter (people, plants, animals, etc.).

== ORCS

[quote,Oralix LeDique]
Orcs are to trees what undeads to the Enlightened.

Green and brown skinned creatures that are created when trees and large plants
die from unnatural causes.

* Orcs are a category containing  orcs, trolls, cyclops
* Not gnolls, goblins or hobs.
* Created completely from plant matter => green and brown skins.
* They exude a kind of blight that slowly degenerates vegetation, which makes
  the orcs stronger.
* Boss Orcs can reverse their blight, killing off a few orcs and rapidly
  increasing plant growth.
* Continue to grow as long as there is nourishment (plant matter).
* Sometimes destroy forests to create more orcs.
* Only become undead if some outside force (such as an evil mage) turns them.
* Tough, extreme pain tolerance, and high morale.
* Individual orcs have animalistic intelligence, but sometimes a Great Leader
  that can control or direct the entire army.
* Die if they are kept away from an open sky for too long; they cannot be 
  imprisoned in a donjon or inside any kind of building - they'll rot.
* Breeder orcs are a kind of "queen" orc that can charm enlightened males into
  mating with them, creating hybrid orc spawn.

Hybrid Orcs::
* Like nephilim
* Intelligent
* Independent
* Very Powerful

== UNDEADS

* Undead creatures rise automatically. Especially if they have died from
  traumatic events such as war, assault, and magical accidents.
* Once slain, some undeads can rise again. Usually as less powerful beings.
* Undeads almost always have worse stats than when they were alive.
* Generally immune to fear.
* Generally slower.
* Generally able to see/sense in darkness.
* Powerful undeads, such as liches, generally do not rise spontaneously.

Mummy Troll::
A troll (who is technically an Orc) that has been magically preserved, wrapped
in magical bandages, and turned undead.

Undeads of the Sea::
Sailors and enlightened sea creatures can become undead.
Sailors tend to walk towards shore and become a menace on the beaches and
harbours of the world. Sea creatures tend to patrol their old territories and
make a mess there.

Crack-Ann:: Female undead Kraken. Rotten and spiteful. Poisonous and stinky
bodily fluids ad nauseam.

Old George::
Male version of Crack-Ann. He's an elderly dude, who is slow and not as young
as he was. Sailors have learned to navigate around him, and generally avoid
him.

== Bug Bears

* Many varieties
* Some are mostly bug, some are mostly bear.

  head.

== GOBLIN

* Evil type of gnome
* A bit like Rask Gar.
* Dark vision.
* Not very fond of gnomes.
* Cowards.
* Power cycles:
** Males are intelligent, cunning, and fierce.
** Females are physically very strong and tough.
** Goblins are less powerful during 12 "daytime" hours.
** ?? On odd years males get a boost to their mental stats, and
   on even years females get a boost to their physical stats.
   This is universal. It means that, no matter where you are,
   you either have clever males or strong females, it varies from year to year.
