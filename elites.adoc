== Barbarian (Warrior Specialization)

* Only has unencumbered item slots.



=== Great Resurrection (X)
*Level 7+, Holy*

This spell can revive anyone with the adventurer's blessing who has not yet
been turned undead and whose level is lower than X.

You must first fast for at least a day, and then you cast this spell,
chanting for <<X>> hours, upon which you touch the corpse of the creature
you wish to revive.

You then permanently lose one point from a random stat - this loss cannot be
undone in any way.
The recipient must roll 1d20 for every stat. If they roll __above__ a stat's
score, that stat is reduced by 1. This usually means that the recipients worst
stats get even worse. These losses are permanent and cannot be undone.

This spell requires a diamond worth at least 400Â·<<X>> gold pieces, which is
consumed by the spell.

Since this spell takes a permanent toll on the caster, it is difficult to find
a caster who is willing to cast this spell, and if they can be persuaded, it 
will most likely be extremely expensive.
